<p>
All-atom contact analysis shows that all published rotamer libraries contain serious van der Waals overlaps <a href="#cite">[1]</a>.  This should not occur as rotamers, being the more common conformations, should have the lower energy states.  Using a select database of 240 high resolution, low-clash score <a href="#cite">[2]</a>, low R<sub>cryst</sub> structures and then filtering it by B-factor and clash score, we have composed a rotamer library, consisting of 153 conformers, which we think is more faithful to the rotamer concept and will improve accuracy of new structures. The library is available as an O database, and this document discussed the use of that database.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">To Use</h3>
<hr align="left" width="65%">
<ol>
	<li><b>Download the tar file from our web or ftp site.</b>
		<div style="margin-left: 30px">
		The rotamer libraries are in a tar'ed Zipped file named  rotsForXView.tar.Z.  The tar file can be downloaded via your browser from either the <a href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/databases/rotamer.html">web site</a> - rotamer section or by maneuvering through the <a href="ftp://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/">FTP site</a> hierarchy:  pub/datasets/rotamers.<br>
		Or, if you prefer, use "anonymous" login to the FTP site.</div><br><br></li>

	<li><b>Extract the files from the tar file.</b>
		<div style="margin-left: 30px">
		These commands will work:<br><br>
			uncompress rotsForXView.tar.Z<br>
			tar -xvf  rotsForXView.tar<br>
			cd rotsForXView</div><br><br></li>
 
 	<li><b>Copy the database to the XtalView data directory.</b>
 		<div style="margin-left: 30px">
 		First create a backup copy of the current rotamer libraries, dict.noh.pdb and dict.allh.pdb.  Then, copy/move the two new rotamer dictionaries, into the XtalView data directory (typically /usr/local/XtalView/data/  ).</div><br><br></li>

	<li><b>You can now select either of these dictionaries from the "Models" pane of Xfit.</b><br><br></li>
</ol>

<p>
	The rotamer dictionary was made from a database of 240 structures at 1.7&Aring; resolution or better. Care was taken to remove side chains which had uncertain positions (eg high B-factors) or systematically misfit conformations. The citation below <a href="#cite">[1]</a> describes our methodology, and the advantages of this library over others previously published.<br></p>

<p>
The approach taken in preparing this file differs from that of the standard rotamer file.</p>
	 <div style="margin-left: 30px">
<p>
Firstly, although the most common rotamer comes first, subsequent rotamers are arranged so that neighbours have similar conformations. This allows you to narrow down your choice to a few rotamers which will be next to each other as you turn the dial.<br></p>
<p>
Secondly, it contains many more rotamers. We examined all rotamers and distributions to avoid (we hope) artifacts.  Thus there are some rare-but-real conformations.  This means that non-rotameric conformations should be viewed with even more suspicion than before.<br></p>

<p>
Thirdly, it contains some non-rotamers! These are sample points in allowed, well populated, relaxed conformations.  They are not, however, local energy minima and thus, strictly, not rotamers. For example, Glu chi3 has a very flat distribution which is populated throughout, so we have included the rotamer at chi3=0 and two sample points at chi3=60 and chi3=-60. There are sample points only for Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Phe and Tyr. They all have their frequency listed as 0%.<br></p></div>

<p>
KNOWN BUGS:<br> Histidine can have several protonation states.  The allh file only allows for one (doubly protonated).  This behaviour is the same as the original files provided with XtalView.</p>
